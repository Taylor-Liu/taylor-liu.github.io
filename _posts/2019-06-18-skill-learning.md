**ICRA'19 Workshop: Learning Legged Locomotion**

- Legged robots are notoriously difficult to control. Recent progress in machine learning has shown promises to design robust and agile locomotion controllers automatically. However, most of these learning-based methods are limited to simulation or to simple hardware platforms. Many challenges remain in bringing these learning-based control approaches to real legged robots, including the reality gap, safe exploration, continuous data collection, data-efficient learning algorithms, experimental evaluation, and hardware robustness.

- This workshop brings together experts in the fields of legged robotics and machine learning/reinforcement learning to discuss the state-of-the-art and challenges in learning-based control of legged robots.

- 众所周知，腿机器人很难控制。机器学习的最新进展表明了自动设计鲁棒灵活的运动控制器的前景。然而，这些基于学习的方法大多局限于仿真或简单的硬件平台。将这些基于学习的控制方法应用于腿式机器人仍然存在许多挑战，包括：仿真和实体之间的差距、安全探索、连续数据收集、数据高效学习算法、实验评估和硬件鲁棒性。

- 这次研讨会将双腿机器人领域和机器学习/强化学习领域的专家汇聚在一起，共同讨论用学习的方法来控制腿式机器人的最新技术和进展。


**ICML‘19 Workshop: Multi-Task and Lifelong Reinforcement Learning**

- Significant progress has been made in reinforcement learning, enabling agents to accomplish complex tasks such as Atari games, robotic manipulation, simulated locomotion, and Go. These successes have stemmed from the core reinforcement learning formulation of learning a single policy or value function from scratch. However, reinforcement learning has proven challenging to scale to many practical real world problems due to problems in learning efficiency and objective specification, among many others. Recently, there has been emerging interest and research in leveraging structure and information across multiple reinforcement learning tasks to more efficiently and effectively learn complex behaviors. This includes:

	1. curriculum and lifelong learning, where the problem requires learning a sequence of tasks, leveraging their shared structure to enable knowledge transfer
	2. goal-conditioned reinforcement learning techniques that leverage the structure of the provided goal space to learn many tasks significantly faster
	3. meta-learning methods that aim to learn efficient learning algorithms that can learn new tasks quickly
	4. hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the reinforcement learning problem might entail a compositions of subgoals or subtasks with shared structure

- Multi-task and lifelong reinforcement learning has the potential to alter the paradigm of traditional reinforcement learning, to provide more practical and diverse sources of supervision, while helping overcome many challenges associated with reinforcement learning, such as exploration, sample efficiency and credit assignment. However, the field of multi-task and lifelong reinforcement learning is still young, with many more developments needed in terms of problem formulation, algorithmic and theoretical advances as well as better benchmarking and evaluation.

- The focus of this workshop will be on both the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of multi-task and lifelong reinforcement learning as well as the practical challenges associated with building multi-tasking agents and lifelong learning benchmarks. Our goal is to bring together researchers that study different problem domains (such as games, robotics, language, and so forth), different optimization approaches (deep learning, evolutionary algorithms, model-based control, etc.), and different formalisms (as mentioned above) to discuss the frontiers, open problems and meaningful next steps in multi-task and lifelong reinforcement learning.
