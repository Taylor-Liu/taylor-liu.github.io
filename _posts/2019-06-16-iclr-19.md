- Abstract
	- Computer simulation provides an automatic and safe way for training robotic control policies to achieve complex tasks such as locomotion. However, a policy trained in simulation usually does not transfer directly to the real hardware due to the differences between the two environments. `Transfer learning using domain randomization is a promising approach, but it usually assumes that the target environment is close to the distribution of the training environments, thus relying heavily on accurate system identification.` In this paper, we present a different approach that leverages domain randomization for transferring control policies to unknown environments. `The key idea that, instead of learning a single policy in the simulation, we simultaneously learn a family of policies that exhibit different behaviors.` When tested in the target environment, we directly search for the best policy in the family based on the task performance, without the need to identify the dynamic parameters. We evaluate our method on five simulated robotic control problems with different discrepancies in the training and testing environment and demonstrate that our method can overcome larger modeling errors compared to training a robust policy or an adaptive policy.

- Abstract
	- Intelligent creatures can explore their environments and learn useful skills without supervision. In this paper, we propose DIAYN (“Diversity is All You Need”), a method for learning useful skills without a reward function. `Our proposed method learns skills by maximizing an information theoretic objective using a maximum entropy policy.` On a variety of simulated robotic tasks, we show that this simple objective results in the unsupervised emergence of diverse skills, such as walking and jumping. In a number of reinforcement learning benchmark environments, our method is able to learn a skill that solves the benchmark task despite never receiving the true task reward. We show how pretrained skills can provide a good parameter initialization for downstream tasks, and can be composed hierarchically to solve complex, sparse reward tasks. `Our results suggest that unsupervised discovery of skills can serve as an effective pretraining mechanism for overcoming challenges of exploration and data efficiency in reinforcement learning.`
