Online Meta-Learning [[Website]](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/ScheduleMultitrack?event=4514)
- Chelsea Finn · Aravind Rajeswaran · Sham Kakade · Sergey Levine
- UC Berkeley
- Notes
	- This work introduces an online meta-learning problem setting, which merges ideas from both the aforementioned paradigms in order to better capture the spirit and practice of continual lifelong learning.
	- FTML: practical instantiation of our approach, extending MAML meta-train on all data so far, fine-tune on current task

Making Deep Q-learning methods robust to time discretization [[Website]](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/ScheduleMultitrack?event=4577)
- Corentin Tallec · Leonard Blier · Yann Ollivier
- Universit´e Paris-Sud, Facebook AI Research
- Notes
	- Problem: Deep Reinforcement Learning is not robust to hyperparameterization, implementation details, or small environment changes. 
	- In this paper, we identify sensitivity to `time discretization` in `near continuous-time environments` as a critical factor; this covers, e.g., `changing the number of frames per second`, or `the action frequency of the controller`.
